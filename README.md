# Clean Kentico12 MVC

An example of Clean/Onion Architecture with [Kentico Xperience 13](https://docs.kentico.com/13)

## Repository Structure

This repository uses the standard .NET approach of a mono-repo, with multiple projects, and deployable units, all contained in a single solution.

There are two deployable units in a Kentico Xperience 13 application, the Content Management (ASP.NET 4.8 Web Forms) application and the Content Delivery (ASP.NET Core 3.1 MVC) application.

In the directory structure below, we can see the separation of these deployable units by top level folders, `delivery`, `management`, with `shared` container projects shared between both deployable units.

## Goals

Provide a source for architectural guidance and discussion for the Kentico Xperience community when building Kentico MVC applications.

> Note: This is not a seed project. The repository can be cloned and added to a CMS application, but the primary goal here is a sandbox for patterns and architecture.

> Feel free to copy and paste the code here into your projects (with attribution).

## High Level Patterns

- Vertical Slices / Feature Focused
- Thin Controllers
- Request -> Handler -> ViewModel
- CQRS - Query -> Dispatcher -> Handler -> Response
- `Result<T>` and `Option<T>` (no `null`)
- Dependency Injection
- Cross-Cutting Concerns via Decoration
- `NodeAliasPath` routing
- Centralized and type-safe Kentico / Output Caching
- Context Abstractions
- Guard Clauses
- Onion Architecture

## How to Use this Repository

Clone this repository locally and open `Sandbox.sln` in Visual Studio.

Then, explore the code base by following code lens references, and using the documentation and diagrams for explanations.

Optional: Connect the repository to a Kentico Xperience CMS (`Sandbox.Management.Web`) application and database and use debugging and code changes to see how requests / responses flow through the architecture.
